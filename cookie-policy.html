                                This document informs Users about the technologies that help
                                this Website to achieve the purposes described below. Such
                                technologies allow the Owner to access and store information
                                (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by
                                running a script) on a User&rsquo;s device as they interact with
                                this Website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as
                                &ldquo;Trackers&rdquo; within this document &ndash; unless there
                                is a reason to differentiate.

                            <p>
                                For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile
                                browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the
                                context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For
                                this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used
                                where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type
                                of Tracker.

                                Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also
                                require the User&rsquo;s consent. Whenever consent is given, it
                                can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions
                                provided in this document.

                                the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of

                                There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and
                                to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly
                                within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the
                                use or storage of Trackers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent,
                                Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their
                                preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such
                                preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences
                                widget, if available.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to
                                delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to
                                remember the User&rsquo;s initial consent.
                            </p>

                                Other Trackers in the browser&rsquo;s local memory may be
                                cleared by deleting the browsing history.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their
                                preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out
                                link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third
