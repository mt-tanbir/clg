                            <p>
                                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
                                the following applies:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                                    purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
                                    allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                                    such processing (&ldquo;opt-out&rdquo;), without having to
                                    rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
                                    This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                                    Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                                    agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                                    obligations thereof;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
                                    to which the Owner is subject;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                                    public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                                    vested in the Owner;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                                    interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
                                legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
                                whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                                contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
                                into a contract.

                                involve transferring the User&rsquo;s Data to a country other
                                than their own. To find out more about the place of processing
                                of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing
